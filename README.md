# Playwright Authentication & Browser Contexts Framework

A production-ready Playwright framework demonstrating **browser contexts, incognito sessions, and authentication state management**.

This project focuses on **real-world login handling**, session reuse, and isolation — exactly how modern test automation is implemented in companies.

##  What This Project Covers

- ✅ Multiple browser contexts
- ✅ Incognito (isolated) sessions
- ✅ Save and reuse authentication state
- ✅ Cookie and storage validation
- ✅ Clean Playwright + TypeScript setup

## Why Browser Contexts Matter

Browser contexts allow you to:
- Test **multiple users in parallel**
- Isolate sessions (like incognito mode)
- Avoid repeated logins by reusing auth state
- Speed up test execution significantly

This framework demonstrates all of that in a **simple, working setup**.
